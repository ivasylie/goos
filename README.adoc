= Contents

OpenFire server for the GOOS example as docker container.

Admin console credentials are admin:admin.
The sniper and auction users have been created as needed for the book.

= Instructions
Requires Boot2Docker. (Edit configuration in build.gradle to use another docker setup)

== Create Images
 
 ./gradlew buildImage

Creates an image 'tma/goos-openfire'.

This might take a while first time.

== Start Containers

 ./gradlew createContainer startContainer

*Note*: `buildImage`, `createConainter` and `startContainer` must be run in that order. But there are no dependencies between them.

== How to use

After creating the image and starting the container the server should be ready to use:

Configurate FakeAuctionServer.java

	public static final String XMPP_HOSTNAME = "192.168.59.103";

And let the tests run. and fail :-P
